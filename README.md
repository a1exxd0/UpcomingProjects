# About me :)
I am a first year Computer Science student at the University of Warwick. Most focussed on learning about how we can use machine learning or other algorithms in time-series analysis, especially in finance, but also highly interested in CS fundamentals and low-level programming.

[Winner](https://devpost.com/software/decarb) of Citadel's ICHack 2024; Europe's biggest student-hackathon as a first year student in Most Innovative Use of Financial Data:
