# About me :)
I am a Computer Science student at the University of Warwick. Most interested in HPC and C++.

# Upcoming Projects
Projects I am looking to complete & have already completed. Not university-associated:
 - [X] [C++ Neural Network from scratch with Eigen](https://github.com/a1exxd0/HaDoLibrary)
 - [ ] [C Compiler in Rust](https://github.com/a1exxd0/acc/)

# Archived Projects
Archived projects I've completed or have had to postpone (or possibly just lacked motivation to do):
 - [X] [Finite Markov chain calculator based in Eigen](https://github.com/a1exxd0/FiniteMarkovChains)
 - [X] [Python standard MNIST Convolutional NN](https://github.com/a1exxd0/PythonConvolutional)
 - [X] [Creating a stack class in C](https://github.com/a1exxd0/CreateClassInC/tree/main/IntegerStack)
 - [ ] [Module & Flavours System for Unix](https://github.com/a1exxd0/scc-modules)
 - [ ] [C++ Ray Tracing Engine](https://github.com/a1exxd0/ray-tracing-engine)
 - [ ] [C++ Compiler](https://github.com/a1exxd0/CPPCompiler/) - realised this was a bit out of scope ;)
