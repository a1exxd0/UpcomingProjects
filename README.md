# About me :)
I am a first year Computer Science student at the University of Warwick. Most interested in low-latency applications of CS and HPC.

Member of the UK National Student Cluster Competition team, and (hopefully) competing in [SC24](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/) in Atlanta in November.

[Winner](https://devpost.com/software/decarb) of Citadel's ICHack 2024; Europe's biggest student-hackathon as a first year student in Most Innovative Use of Financial Data:
