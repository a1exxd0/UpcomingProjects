# About me :)
I am a first year Computer Science student at the University of Warwick. Most focussed on learning about how we can use machine learning or other algorithms in time-series analysis, especially in finance, but also highly interested in CS fundamentals and low-level programming.

# Upcoming Projects
Projects I am looking to complete & have already completed. Not university-associated.
 - [X] Python standard MNIST Convolutional NN (https://github.com/a1exxd0/PythonConvolutional)
 - [ ] C++ 2 category convolutional NN
 - [X] Creating a stack class in C (https://github.com/a1exxd0/CreateClassInC/tree/main/IntegerStack)
 - [ ] Finite Markov chain calculator for probability of state transitions in n steps (https://github.com/a1exxd0/FiniteMarkovChains)
 - [ ] C++ Multithreaded Server
 - [ ] Time-series analysis on seasonal weather data in London to predict future temperature
